Coloquei isso para corrigir o eslint:

The SOLID ideas are

S => single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
O => open–closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
L => The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." See also design by contract.
The interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
I => The dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions,  concretions."
D => The SOLID acronym was introduced later, around 2004, by Michael Feathers.
